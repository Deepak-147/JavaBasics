/**
 * Polymorphism: means many forms
 * It allows objects of different types to be treated as if they are of a common type.
 * In simpler terms, think of it like this: imagine you have a remote control with buttons, and no matter what device you point it at—a TV, a DVD player, or a stereo—it knows how to control it. 
 * Similarly, in programming, polymorphism allows you to use a common interface (like a remote control) to work with different types of objects (like devices) without needing to know their specific types at compile time.
 * 
 * Two main types of Polymporphism: Compile-time and Run-time
 * 
 * Java supports two types of polymorphism:
 * 1. Compile-time Polymorphism (Method Overloading) or Static binding: Compiler determines which overloaded method to call based on the method signature during compilation.
 * 2. Run-time Polymorphism (Method Overriding) or Dynamic binding or Dynamic Method Dispatch: The determination of which method to execute is made at runtime based on the actual type of the object, not the reference type.
 * 
 * We can implement method overloading in two different ways:
   - implementing two or more methods that have the same name but take different numbers of arguments
   - implementing two or more methods that have the same name but take arguments of different types
 * */

		// When one given type is implicitly promoted to another one when there’s no matching between the types of the arguments passed to the overloaded method and a specific method implementation.
